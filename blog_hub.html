                                <h3><a href="blogs/emotional_content.html">Video Games, Electronic Literature, and Emotional Content: What does it do? Does it do anything? Let’s find out!!</a></h3>
                                <p><i>Originally Written December 19th, 2019 | Updated July 22nd, 2020</i></br>
                                    Video games and electronic literature are able to simplify, exaggerate, and explore issues that happen in real life. Abuse, racism, sexism, coming out to family, and anxieties related to death, the future, and artificial intelligence (AI) are just a few of the topics that are covered by these interactive mediums. In tandem, various frameworks have been created in order to examine the ways in which video games and electronic literature are structured. I will go through a few of these theories – including Ryan’s (2011) onion, Moulthrop’s (2017) intimate mechanics, Rigby and Ryan’s (2007) player experience of need model, and Bogost’s (2007) procedural rhetoric – and examine their usefulness in analyzing not only structure but content of their respective mediums. I will particularly look at how AI is viewed in electronic literature and video games, and how these representations play into fears and anxieties surrounding this topic.</p>

								<h3><a href="blogs/character_immersion.html">Character Immersion: How Romance Facilitates Player Immersion through Ludic and Narrative Elements</a></h3>
                                <p><i>Originally Written April 16th, 2018 | Updated July 22nd, 2020</i></br>
                                    Character immersion – that is, how much the player feels their actions are properly reflected through their character – is mediated by the amount of constraint the videogame narrative has over the player. I therefore contend that character immersion is mediated by narrative and ludic strength. Videogames that focus on either having a highly structured and linear story, or focus on the unique experience of the player through their actions, leads to less character immersion. A mixture of the two would lead to more immersive character experiences.</p>

								<h3><a href="blogs/disobedience.html">Disobedience: The Power of Player Agency</a></h3>
                                <p><i>Originally Written March 31st, 2018 | Updated July 18th, 2020</i></br>
                                	In this short paper I’ll be going over Favis’s (2016) view of disobedience in games, and I reason that disobedience within a game is a very deliberate, intentional decision by the game developer to include and in turn for the player to commit.</p>
