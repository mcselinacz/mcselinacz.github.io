                                <h2>Video Games, Electronic Literature, and Emotional Content: What does it do? Does it do anything? Let’s find out!!</h2>
                                <h4>Originally Written December 19th, 2019 for DH 500: Survey of Digital Humanities at the University of Alberta | Updated July 18th, 2020</h4>
                                <p>Video games and electronic literature are able to simplify, exaggerate, and explore issues that happen in real life. Abuse, racism, sexism, coming out to family, and anxieties related to death, the future, and artificial intelligence (AI) are just a few of the topics that are covered by these interactive mediums. In tandem, various frameworks have been created in order to examine the ways in which video games and electronic literature are structured. I will go through a few of these theories – including Ryan’s (2011) onion, Moulthrop’s (2017) intimate mechanics, Rigby and Ryan’s (2007) player experience of need model, and Bogost’s (2007) procedural rhetoric – and examine their usefulness in analyzing not only structure but content of their respective mediums. I will particularly look at how AI is viewed in electronic literature and video games, and how these representations play into fears and anxieties surrounding this topic.</p>
                                <h3>Frameworks</h3>
                                <p>I first look at electronic literature frameworks. Ryan’s (2011) onion looks at the different layers which make literature interactive. Her onion’s layers include: peripheral interactivity, interactivity affecting narrative discourse and the presentation of the story, interactivity creating variations in a partly pre-defined story, real time story generation, and meta-interactivity. Each layer goes from shallow interactivity to more in-depth interactivity, with meta-interactivity being a level of interactivity so entwined with the player that it is not yet possible to achieve such a work. Ryan (2011) states that “to constitute a genuinely ‘meta’ interactivity, this must be done by writing code and patching up the source, rather than by using tools internal to the game, such as the house-building module of <i>The Sims</i>. It is on this level that the idea of the user as co-author becomes more than a hyperbolic cliché, but the two roles do not merge, since users cannot simultaneously immerse themselves in a storyworld and write the code that brings this world to life”. </p>
                                <p>In contrast, Moulthrop’s (2017) intimate mechanics looks at the dichotomy of scripton (the combination of textonic pieces into more meaningful units) versus texton (the smallest unit of information), and everything in between these two extremes. And in between these two extremes lies electronic literature, the mixing of code that represents the textonic under-workings and the scriptonic understandings of the meaning of the work. The accessibility of electronic literature and resources like Twine, including the melding of the textonic and scriptonic, is a ripe area for the intimacy of mechanics, which Moulthrop pulls from Ellison’s mechanics of intimacy (Moulthrop, 2017). Moulthrop (2017) states that themes of consciousness, being, and personal relationships are intimate themes, with varying mechanics being used to express these through time. Moulthrop (2017) uses <i>Howling Dogs</i> (Porpentine, 2012) as an example of the perception of the textonic through the variations of scripton. The player is repeatedly thrown into the same, metal dark room after each fantastical experience the player goes through, revealing “the pattern of survival and impossible escape implicit in the carceral logic of the game” (Moulthrop, 2017). </p>
                                <p>Moving from electronic literature into video games, Rigby and Ryan’s (2007) player experience of need model sets out to measure and understand the player experience, meaningful play, and fun through specifically defined principles. PENS is designed to “first and foremost be able to describe the underlying energy that fuels actions in the first place across all types of games” which is also described as the ‘motivational lightbox’ (Rigby & Ryan, 2007). Rigby and Ryan’s (2007) PENS is based off of three psychological principles – competence, autonomy, and relatedness – which translate into three game aspects: game mechanics which include the UI and mechanics, gameplay which includes the moment to moment activity and content that the player experiences in the game, and player narrative which refers to the development of the player’s character over time including metagame elements (such as gamescore).</p>
                                <p>Bogost (2007) on the other hand delves into the medium’s procedural rhetoric – the way that games make arguments through the actions that creators allow players to take, and the players subsequently taking those actions within the game world. As he states, “the possibility space of play includes all of the gestures made possible by a set of rules” (Bogost, 2007). The player is limited by the actions that the games gives them, and the game presses the player to act in certain ways which influences them as they are the ones taking those actions. In his paper, Bogost (2007) uses <i>Animal Crossing</i> as an example of the game creating a materialistic message that buying more and more leads to more and more debt as the player builds their house, pays off their debt to Tom Nook, and then receive more upgrades to their house, leading to more debt to pay off.</p>
                                <h3>Videogame Content</h3>
                                <p>Although these frameworks focus on the structure of the medium from different perspectives, they do not necessarily focus on the content - specifically the emotional content - of the medium. Content is another important aspect of game development, especially when considering the emotional responses of players who interact, respond, and ingest these mediums. I look at how these models fail to consider content including some examples.</p>
                                <p>Ryan’s (2011) onion looks at the interactivity that the player experiences and their subsequent personal involvement and relationship with the system that vessels the interactive story or game. She explores how various layers of interactivity evoke responses from players in certain ways, but the content of stories is not explored. Ryan (2011) uses <i>Façade</i> as an example for her fourth layer of interactivity. <i>Façade</i> has a natural language interface which allows the player to interact with a couple as they fight about their marriage, creating a narrative which unfolds as the player experiences and interacts with it (Ryan, 2011). This is an example of interactivity through the story developing as the player responds to it, but the content of the game itself may not have a lasting impact on the player. <i>Façade</i> generally leaves players feeling frustrated (Cohen, 2013). Although interactivity is increased, the content of the game is emotionally shallow and leaves the player without investment into the marriage that is falling apart in front of them. <i>Detroit: Become Human</i> (Cage, 2018) is a more interactively shallow piece of literature, as the story is already pre-determined and the player chooses which path to follow, but gives the player a more emotionally complex experience as they are directly involved in the action of the story. Their emotional investment into the characters they play as and interact with leaves a lasting impact on them. The depth of interaction is explored by Ryan (2011), but not on an emotional level which also affects how much the player feels they are interacting with the game or literature. </p>
                                <p>Rigby and Ryan’s (2007) PENS model also has a heavy focus on the structure of the game. Although they do mention content in their model, it is more of a focus on the content in terms of how the player interacts with said content, rather than the content itself. For example, they discuss <i>Oblivion</i> and how NPCs interact differently with the main character once they have completed main quests in the game. This is meant to enhance the player’s feeling of relatedness to the content of the game world around them. Again, this is more focused at how the structure of the game enhances the player experience, but not necessarily how the content of the game itself enhances the player experience. In <i>Skyrim</i> (Howard, 2011), when players become a vampire and their sickness develops to a certain stage, they will no longer be welcome into towns and people will attack them on sight. Their actions have affected the world around them, but the context of being a vampire and being chased out of towns could either be thrilling or horrifying to players. According to the PEN model, this could increase the relatedness of the player as the world responds to their actions, but the player may be left with a negative feeling due to the consequences of the content they now interact with, and thus do not actually interact more with the game. </p>
                                <p>Additionally, Bogost (2007) does delve into the content of video games, stating that “video games are usually created with some expressive purpose in mind; they represent models of systems or spaces that players can inhabit, rather than serving as mere tools”. But in his paper, he does not delve into video games which have a procedural rhetoric that can leave players feeling negative, especially women and minorities. For example, in <i>God of War 3</i> (Asmussen, 2010), how are players suppose to decipher the meaning of playing as Kratos, who sleeps with Aphrodite instead of fighting her (as he does with all the other enemy gods encountered in the game), while her handmaids watch on in delight at his sexual prowess? Rather than having a message like <i>Spec Ops: The Line</i> (Davis & Coulon, 2012) – a classic example of procedural rhetoric leaving a lasting and emotional impact on the player - this piece of gameplay reinforces simplified and sexist representations of women. According to Bogost (2007) this is the procedural rhetoric represented in the game, but the negative emotional impact on women or minorities playing the game would not be explicitly considered in his framework. </p>
                                <p>Of all these frameworks, Moulthrop’s (2017) intimacy of mechanics touches the most on the content within the electronic literature or game. His intimacy of mechanics touches upon the themes of the work, including questions of relationships, consciousness, and the “expressiveness of story and the logic of game” (Moulthrop, 2017). His intimacy of mechanics is especially relevant for games that are made in Twine, as the textonic and the scriptonic are very closely related, as described above. However, it has also been seen in mainstream video games as well. In <i>Detroit: Become Human</i>, it is explicitly stated to the player that they are playing a game, and their decisions decide how the story plays out. This story has not happened, but it could. This closes the gap between the textonic and the scriptonic; however, Moulthrop does not explicitly go into how this could either deepen the player’s emotional response to the content of the game, or negatively impact their investment into the content and the story of the game.</p>
                                <p>Overall, none of these frameworks explicitly tap into the player’s emotional response due to the content of the game as they play it. In particular, games with a focus on AI seem to tap into several anxieties that people have about how ‘smart’ actual AI can be. By ‘smart’ I refer to the idea that AI is intelligent as a human could be considered intelligent, rather than coming to decisions based on algorithmic procedures. AI has made wide leaps into making decisions that could be considered ‘smart’, such as learning new strategies for games, but this is still nowhere near the intelligence of humans (EurekAlert!, 2019). Before delving further into this topic, I will note one particular difference in AI represented in video games versus the real world. This is the ‘smartness’ of AI. As described above, AI in the real world is nowhere near the level of humans; however, in video games, there is the assumption that AI is either based on human consciousness, and therefore has the same emotional capacity of decision-making as humans, or that it is as intelligent as humans. </p>
                                <h3>Artificial Intelligence and its Anxieties</h3>
                                <p>I will look at games that represent AI in a variety of ways and how these games tap into anxieties surrounding AI. Specifically, I will look at how the design of AI either looking human or using a human voice, how the player interacts with the AI, and how the AI is generally seen as oppressive can create fear and anxiety within the player, or how it can bridge the gap between technology and humanity.</p>
                                <p>GLaDOS from the <i>Portal</i> series (Swift, 2007; Weier, 2011) is a classic example of AI representation in video games. She is a seemingly sentient AI system which has gone haywire, using her testing chambers to test her subject’s skills and tormenting them until their death. She has the voice of a woman mixed in with the robotic tone of a robot, and additionally uses human figures of speech, such as sarcasm and humor. Her goal throughout the majority of the first game is to first test chambers, and then later to use said test chambers to kill Chell. This is a classic example of the fear surrounding AI and its darker implications – that it will eventually rise up against us, overpower us, and kill us. This is exemplified by the fact that GLaDOS has human qualities – that she has the intelligence of a human and thus speaks like one. There is a clear fear of AI’s capabilities. This is exemplified further in the second game, since it is revealed that the consciousness of a woman named Caroline was inserted into GLaDOS, further deepening the connection between human and murderous AI. This theme is also explored with Wheatley, another AI with a personality that becomes corrupted once he has power over the Aperture Test Facility. Here, the content of the AI systems actively trying to kill humans is a clear emotionally driven core which engages players, but also makes them anxious to escape out of the facility alive. The characterization of GLaDOS as a murderous robot with human qualities also makes her an engaging character, making the content of the game an important aspect to keep players interested in the puzzles.</p>
                                <p>A more recent example of AI in video games is <i>Detroit: Become Human</i>. A main theme in the game is androids used as slave labor, and their subsequent fight for freedom against their human captors. This theme directly pulls from recent advances in AI. This is very topical considering the advances made in recent years with androids – there is Sophia (Urbi, 2018) as well as service robots being developed in Japan (Himmer, 2019). Looking like a human gives this uncanny valley effect, making people think that these robots have the same intellectual capabilities as humans – far exceeding what they can actually do. David Cage plays this up to the fullest in <i>Detroit: Become Human</i>.</p>
                                <p>In a flip of the usual narrative, humans are the oppressors of androids, and the androids are slowly becoming sentient through something that is described as a ‘virus’ which allows them to defy the instructions of their masters. Players play as three different androids, allowing them to sympathize and feel emotionally attached to the androids rather than the humans in the game. However, due to the branching narrative, players can also choose to take very negative actions as the androids. Marcus’s story is focused on an entire android revolution – this can be done very positively, with minimal violence and a positive outcome, leading to a positive emotional connection with androids and AI. But, if the player decides to do the violent revolution route, it leads to extreme violence by both androids and humans. Connor, if he does not take enough interest in his partner’s life or become emotionally attached to him, will eventually lead to his partner’s death. These examples of android violence accompanied with the parallels between human and android can lead to emotionally distraught players that are still quite emotionally invested in the story because of the android viewpoint. This emotional reaction is unattached from the gameplay – since it is a David Cage game, it is mostly button mashing and narrative decision making. Nothing too compelling. The compelling aspect is the content which invests the player into the game and the anxiety they may feel. </p>
                                <p>All of these games represent interesting content which invests the player into the story and the characters of the game, making them want to play more, while not being related to the actual gameplay or mechanics. This makes the previously mentioned models insufficient to explain how this content and emotional investment can either motivate a player to keep playing the game, or to put it down and stop from playing. I believe this is an important area of game design which should be explored further. </p>
                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>Overall, the emotional content of electronic literature and games is important to capture the experience of the player. There are certain factors which, in general, contribute to these emotional feelings and create an impactful experience for the player. These factors include personal engagement, which I define as how well the game either explores as issue or topic that is currently happening in the real world. Abuse, personal relationships, sexual experiences, consciousness, the rise of technology and artificial intelligence, and the meaning of life are all topics which can be safely explored through electronic literature and games and personally engages player in the content of the game. These are emotionally charged topics which can invest players through their intimate nature (Moulthrop, 2017). Another factor is how the factors are explored and the sensitivity with which they are explored. These emotionally charged topics can be represented in an exaggerated way as long as it is done with enough sensitivity around the topic. David Cage appropriating the civil rights movement in <i>Detroit: Become Human</i> for his android rights movement is in poor taste and does not engage the player in an emotionally intelligent way. On the other hand, the genuine relationship which can build between Connor and Hank emotionally engages players with their at-first awkward engagements. Over time, the interactions between an android hating human and an android with no emotional understanding develops into a caring relationship that the player has helped evolve, making them emotionally invested.</p>
                                <p>In conclusion, the content and emotional response of the game is an important aspect to explore when trying to engage players. Some game studies frameworks touch upon the emotional content of electronic literature and games, but do not explicitly explore how emotional content can be utilized to engage the player. An explicit framework for looking at the content of games, and how emotional engagement can keep players playing a game, is a beneficial resource for game design and game analysis. I touched upon two factors – personal engagement and sensitivity – which are important when discussing this topic. I believe further research into this area, including comparisons with other established frameworks, would be an interesting line of research.</p>
