                                <h2>Character Immersion: How Romance Facilitates Player Immersion through Ludic and Narrative Elements</h2>
                                <h4>Originally Written April 16th, 2018 for CLIT 210: Cyberliterature at the University of Alberta | Updated July 22nd, 2020</h4>
                                <p>Character creation has been a staple in videogames, with early examples including <i>Pool of Radiance</i> (Kroegel, 1988) and other <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> (Gygax & Arneson, 1974) inspired electronic games. In recent years, it has taken on an entirely new approach – no longer is character creation simply about choosing an avatar through which you experience the game would, but it includes everything from appearance, race, backstory, attributes, and personality. Additionally, Shepard (2014) discusses how character creation extends beyond the customization menu, affecting non-player character (NPC) relationships, play style, and player immersion. Romance has subsequently become a staple in most open world games, leading players to develop emotional attachments between their characters and NPCs. However, character immersion – that is, how much the player feels their actions are properly reflected through their character – is mediated by the amount of constraint the videogame narrative has over the player. I therefore contend that character immersion is mediated by narrative and ludic strength. Videogames that focus on either having a highly structured and linear story, or focus on the unique experience of the player through their actions, leads to less character immersion. A mixture of the two would lead to more immersive character experiences.</p>
                                <p>Thon (2008) describes videogame immersion as a psychological effect on the player, with their attentive, non-trivial actions on objects within the game environment acting as transference to the game world. In order to capture the multidimensionality of immersion, Thon (2008) describes four immersion subtypes, of which I will be focusing on two to describe character immersion – ludic and narrative immersion.  Ludic immersion includes the spatial and interactional limits of the player within the rules of the game world, such as their avatar’s movements and fighting abilities (Thon, 2008). The player’s interaction with the world in turn affects the world itself. This ties in with narrative immersion, which is dictated by the lore of the game world, cutscenes presenting a story to the player, as well as character development and the game environment as a whole (Thon, 2008). While narrative events are pre-determined, ludic events occur within the moment of the game and differ from player to player. The narrative, therefore, can be affected by the player’s ludic interaction within the videogame.</p>
                                <p>However, while Thon (2008) briefly touches upon the role of avatars in terms of spatial immersion, she does not delve into the player’s immersive experience directly through their avatar. In this regard, I argue that ‘character’ differs from ‘avatar’. The avatar is the physical manifestation of the player’s character – that is, the attributes not defined by the avatar’s model (Shepard, 2014) – within the videogame. The character of the player’s avatar is determined by the player’s choices and actions, from creation to key decisions during the videogame’s narrative. These lead to unique decisions, dialogue, or story beats based on character creation choices (Shepard, 2014). For example, being an orc in <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i> (Howard, 2011) opens up race specific dialogue from guards, and orc players can enter orc strongholds without being attacked on sight. I therefore argue that character immersion is a mixture of ludic and narrative immersion. By adding weight to the player’s actions and combining them with a narrative backstory that immerses the player within the game, the player feels that their character’s actions are reflected by the dynamic change of the game world and narrative. If one or the other is lacking, the player may still feel immersed in the game, but they will not have the same emotional connection to their character and in-game relationships. I contest that a prime example of character immersion in videogames is through romantic interests.</p>
                                <h3>Skyrim</h3>
                                <p>Certain videogames focus on one type of immersion over the other, and thus suffer in the player’s extent of character immersion. Ludic immersion lends itself to games with open worlds, random encounters, and interactive events that affect the world in a non-linear fashion, such as <i>Skyrim</i>. <i>Skyrim</i> has complete character customization including factions the player can choose to join such as the Thieves’ Guild, personal character goals, and quest decisions which affect the game world as a whole. If the player goes as far as ignoring the main questline, they can complete most of the game without learning they are Dragonborn. This lends well to ludic immersion, as the player carves their own path through the world, supplemented by random encounters and events that are affected by the player making their own decisions. For example, if the player wishes to become a skilled archer, they must perform archer actions such as using a bow to kill enemies (Shepard, 2014). If they so decide, the player can roleplay as a hunter that never becomes Dragonborn, instead joining the Companions and becoming a renown monster slayer. Nothing in the videogame besides the opening sequence is mandatory to complete and yet the player’s actions have lasting effects on Skyrim. The fact that the player-character’s intentional actions have consequences that differ from player to player lends itself to the player’s immersion into their unique character.</p>
                                <p>This freedom is also reflected in <i>Skyrim</i>’s romances. <i>Skyrim</i> has a large romance pool of sixty-six marriage partners; however, this large selection of romance candidates leads to less narrative immersion as all the NPCs have the same romance lines, with little to no investment in the player-character - at times, the player-character can marry their romantic interest the first time they interact. These superficial relationships take the player out of the immersive experience, as there is minimal effort needed from the player to initiate these romantic connections. Additionally, marriage does not drastically change the world as some of the player’s other decisions do. All it unlocks is the ability to have the player-character’s partner move into their home, cook them meals, and call them ‘dear’. This does not have the same impact as, for example, killing Emperor Titus Mede II does when the player joins The Dark Brotherhood. Without deliberate attention to the narrative of such relationships, they fall flat for the player’s character immersion. In <i>Skyrim</i>, the narrative immersion is sacrificed for the ludic experience of the player. In this sense, character immersion is strong as the player-character’s actions reflect an immediate, impactful change in the game world; however, the lacking narrative immersion makes these changes only superficial in nature. </p>
                                <h3>Dragon Age: Inquisition</h3>
                                <p>On the other hand, videogames with a focus on narrative immersion and more structured, pre-determined stories also limit true character immersion. Videogames like <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i> (Laidlaw, 2014) have more limited character freedom due to the stricter narrative structure. The player can choose the character’s look, their race which determines most of their background, and their personality; however, despite all these options they must narratively still become the Herald of Andraste. Character immersion is broken because the player is <i>always</i> the Inquisitor and the overall narrative progresses almost identically from playthrough to playthrough. There are minimal changes to intermediate events and the game’s conclusion even with player’s varied actions, making the player feel that their choices are artificial to changing the game world. For example, while being rude to some NPCs drives them from the player’s party, others are cemented due to their important status to the narrative, creating unrealistic scenarios. No matter how much Solas despises the player-character – even if they punch him in the face - he will not leave their side. That doesn’t sound like a real elf. This limited ludic immersion breaks the character immersion of the game, as the player’s character actions are not properly reflected through narrative changes.</p>
                                <p>However, the limitation of romance options allows for more deep, complex relationships. While there are fewer romance options than <i>Skyrim</i>, this also leads to deeper character development with non-trivial investment needed from the player in order to progress relationships. The player’s decisions to main quests affect NPC affinities, such as choosing to bring the Grey Wardens in as part of the Inquisition. This gains approval from Blackwall but loses significant approval from Solas. Since approval affects relationships, players may shape their character around the NPC they wish to romance, immersing them in the persona their actions facilitate. Certain NPCs also have certain partner preferences which add to their complexity; for example, the romance with Solas can only be initiated if the player is a female elf, leading to higher investment to players that have chosen this specific character; character immersion is enhanced with the player feeling their character is a match for their romantic interest. On the other hand, if a player-character is rejected by Solas, this may lead to the character becoming bitter towards him, implying deeper motivations and characterization. Due to this narrative immersion, romances are progressed as the player progresses through main plot missions, forcing the player to take on a mantle of power in order to fully develop relationships. Character immersion is facilitated by the deep narrative story of <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>, with romance entwined into this structure. Therefore, <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i> lacks ludic immersion for the sake of narrative immersion, which overall reduces character immersion. Although players have more investment in relationships and the narrative of the videogame, including character and world outcomes, forcing them into a savior role removes the options the player is afforded. Their experience may not be as unique as in <i>Skyrim</i> but there is more narrative investment, making the player’s character more developed and reflecting a different aspect of character immersion.</p>
                                <h3>Stardew Valley</h3>
                                <p>Finally, I contest that there is an in-between that allows complete character immersion with <i>Stardew Valley</i> (Barone, 2016). This videogame gives complete freedom in character creation, but also has a narrative structure with linear plot development while affording the player a wide variety of options. <i>Stardew Valley</i> is similar to <i>Skyrim</i> as the only mandatory event the player has to complete is the opening prologue sequence. After this the player has total control over what they wish to accomplish, which leads to unique experiences for each player. This is strong ludic immersion. Additionally, <i>Stardew Valley</i> has a structured narrative with stronger narrative immersion, reflecting <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>’s deeper character relationships and narrative developments. Buying a pendant to signal marriage (such as in <i>Skyrim</i>) is not enough for NPCs to fall in love with the player-character. Relationships develop over time as they do in <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>, but they are not reliant on narrative quests to be initiated. Therefore, <i>Stardew Valley</i> mixes ludic and narrative immersion leading to the player feeling deeply connected to their character through meaningful actions and (romantic) relationships.</p>
                                <p>What is interesting is that, despite <i>Stardew Valley</i>’s narrative freedom, personal narratives are well-developed. Each character is unique, and developing a romantic relationship with a character is not dependent on the player-character’s position of power. For example, the only reason the player-character would interact with the romance options in <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i> is because of their sudden, powerful position. In <i>Stardew Valley</i>, simply being a villager that interacts with other characters is sufficient to develop romantic relations – whatever the player wishes to focus on, such as fishing or farming or mining, does not matter to their romantic interest, leading to stronger character immersion. Additionally, deeper character development is not reliant on the player completing main quests. Progression is shown with the changing of the seasons – the player is creating relationships as time passes. NPCs also have relationships with each other, which adds to the fact that the player-character is not the classic videogame savior that has everyone fall in love with them. If Emily is not romanced and the player develops a strong relationship with Clint, he will ask her on a date, even though she is a romance option for the player. This differs from the way relationships are developed between characters in <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>. The player is not necessarily directly involved with these friendships or romances - although Blackwall and Josephine may develop a relationship together if they are not romanced by the Inquisitor, the Inquisitor does not need to be close to either of them for this to happen. Therefore, building relationships is non-trivial as the player immerses themselves in the character they want to be in order to woo Hayley over Shane, to build friendships and relationships between villagers, and to help Pelican Town thrive in their own way.</p>
                                <p>Ludic immersion is also used in relationship development in <i>Stardew Valley</i>. The player can give certain NPCs gifts, with each one offering a unique reaction from the NPC. The player’s action – giving the NPC a gift – has an impact on their character’s relationship with them, creating meaningful consequences. If the player gives their NPC a nice gift, this will deepen their relationship, while a bad gift will make the NPC upset. This differs from <i>Skyrim</i> in which the player can literally attack their spouse to the brink of death with little to no reaction from them. Weak protests are immediately stopped and forgotten as soon as the player speaks with them after the attack. Using ludic immersion to enhance character immersion continues after marriage in <i>Stardew Valley</i>, such as giving the player the ability to divorce their spouse, to have children, or even erase their spouse’s memories. Most of these are still limited by narrative immersion as they are initiated by the relationship between the player and their NPC spouse. This also deepens character immersion because the player-character’s actions affect these outcomes. The more immersed the player becomes in their character’s relationships, personality, and decisions, the more they will unlock and experience.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, <i>Stardew Valley</i> has the ludic freedom of <i>Skyrim</i>, yet the narrative complexity of <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>. Once relationships are developed, each one is unique and there is a multitude of options that the player has, reflecting the massive open world style of <i>Skyrim</i>; however, the narrative is well-developed and allows for natural progression through the player’s ever-improving farm, their relationships, and the different game events that can be initiated with player action. </p>
                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>In conclusion, character immersion extends beyond character creation and customization (Shepard, 2014). Ludic immersion is important to character immersion as it properly reflects player action through changes in the environment, which also affect their character. A videogame which allows the player-character to have non-trivial impact in the environment immerses the player into the motivations of their character. This is also true for narrative immersion, as it facilitates shallow relationships to become deeper with narrative context and world building. Pre-determined events immerse the player in the world of their character, developing meaningful relationships that has the player emotionally invested in their character’s own development as well. A player can only become truly immersed when love is in the air. </p>
