                                <h2>Disobedience: The Power of Player Agency</h2>
                                <h4>Originally Written March 31st, 2018 for CLIT 210: Cyberliterature at the University of Alberta | Updated July 18th, 2020</h4>
								<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disobedience">Disobedience</a> - that is, refusing to follow orders - is a videogame function that has been on the rise in recent years. In this short paper I’ll be going over Favis’s (2016) view of disobedience in games, and I reason that disobedience within a game is a very deliberate, intentional decision by the game developer to include and in turn for the player to commit.</p>
                                <p>Favis (2016) argues that videogames which want to be disobeyed, and which are designed for disobedience by the player, are a new, emerging class of videogames. Specifically, it is a new form of videogame narrative that the player does not have to listen to – the player of the videogame has agency over their adherence to the rules of the game. This leads to a subversion of expectations, both through optional obedience or disobedience. Favis (2016) also discusses how the agency of the player affects the outcome of disobedience, as players who have the option to disobey readily choose so willingly. Contradictory instructions lead to a reverse psychological effect on the player, spurring them to push the limits of the unreliable narrator and construct their own chronicle, as seen with <i>The Stanley Parable</i> (Wreden & Pugh, 2013; Favis, 2016).</p>
                                <p>I noticed that Favis (2016) focuses on videogames where the disobedience by the player is entirely optional; that is, the player is still rewarded in some way for following the instructions the game gives them to follow. But, they can also discover more about the story or game by explicitly deciding to disobey. Therefore, disobedience is not necessarily a narrative function, but rather a procedural one. To disobey the narrator in <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, the player must physically move Stanley through the door on the right when instructed to go through the door on the left. This differs from defiance in a choose-your-own-adventure style videogame, as the option to defy is generally shown to the player through a text or button. You want to be defiant? <strong>CHOOSE ME!</strong> For example in <i>Mass Effect</i> (Hudson, 2007), defiance is (usually) shown through the Renegade options, versus the more just or ‘good’ Paragon choices. The player knows what to expect when choosing the Renegade option and does so - not in <i>true</i> defiance - but because they may want to access certain skills, see the narrative from a different perspective, or unlock different missions. On the other hand, in games like <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, it is not clearly presented to players that defiance is an option or that it will lead to unique experiences. The player’s intentional movement to challenge the narrator is integral to furthering the disobedient narrative. The player’s deliberate decision-making of the player-character’s physical movement is therefore procedurally necessary to videogame defiance.</p>
                                <p>Also, forcing the player to defy orders removes their power to make their own decisions, reverting the disobedience to a narrative plot point (Favis, 2016). As Richardson (2011) describes, disobedience becomes the norm and the player’s agency is removed. For example, in <i>Broken Age</i> (Schafer, 2015), Vella must disobey the tradition of her village by destroying the creature that she would be sacrificed to and eaten by. There is no option in the game to wait out the ceremony and see Vella’s fate otherwise. Therefore, I think that optionality is a fundamental aspect to the disobedience that Favis (2016) considers. The power of disobedience comes from the unnatural aspect of it; in other words, it is expected in games for players to follow its instructions, so when this expectation is subverted, it leads to a feeling of triumph (Richardson, 2011). If a player tries disobeying the narrator in <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, and recognizes that their actions have significance, it gives the player agency that they would not have felt if they were forced to defy. The narrative changes dynamically with their decisions. This is in opposition to the clear narrative direction <i>Broken Age</i> takes when the player disobeys as they are expected to do.</p>
                                <p>A point of contention I had with Favis’s (2016) argument is that she does not define the line between what is considered disobedience in a videogame and what is not. For example, it could be argued that <i>Stardew Valley</i> (Barone, 2016) is a game that wants to be disobeyed. Although the player is given a farm and instructions on how to improve it, the player can entirely abandon this goal and instead become a fisher or an explorer. The mechanics of the game give the player a lot of freedom to decide how they want to play. The suggestive directions from the villagers for the player to improve their farm can be defied if the player instead wants to get reach the bottom of the mine; however, this is implicit rather than explicit disobedience. Although the player can abandon the farm gifted to them by their grandfather, this disobedience does not change the core narrative of the game. The player still moves to Stardew Valley, the seasons still change, and non-playable character relationships develop despite the decisions of the player. The player only feels their disobedience implicitly, with no external feedback from the game. I therefore conclude that <i>Stardew Valley</i>, and similar videogames, would not fit Favis’s (2016) explicit disobedience.</p>
                                <p>I therefore would propose a more structured definition for what is considered disobedience in videogames. I argue that disobedience must be an action taken by the player that subtends the instructions given to them either by the game or another non-playable character. The narrative is explicitly changed depending on whether the player decides to disobey or not, making the character feel in control of their experience within the videogame. This increases the agency and weight of their actions. This would take into account unreliable narrators, such as in <i>The Stanley Parable</i>; the player, disenchanted with the narrator’s backward description of their actions, has the ability to create their own story. However, this disobedience must also be a procedural choice that extends further than, for example, clicking a mouse to choose the ‘defy’ option. This procedural and narrative duality situates the player in a powerful, interactive position within the videogame. </p>
